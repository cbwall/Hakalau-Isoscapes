Stable isotope analysis of plants and soil in remnant and restored koa stands in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Koa (*Acacia koa*) leaves, understory plants (*Rubus* spp.), and soil in remanant forests where cattle have been excluded and in restored forests where cattle once roamed and vegetation was cleared in 19th century. Plots (20 x 35m) were laid out in each forest stand with samples collected within 4 x 5m subplots (*A. koa* or *Rubus* spp.) or at spatially explicit intervals (soil) to create an isotope-map, or "isoscape," of δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isotope values.
