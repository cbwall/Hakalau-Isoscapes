SILL: The value at which the model first flattens out.,,,,,,,,
RANGE: The distance at which the model first flattens out.,,,,,,,,
NUGGET: The value at which the semi-variogram (almost) intercepts the y-value.,,,,,,,,
The spherical model is one of the most common models we use in variogram modeling,,,,,,,,
"This object contains the experimental variogram,the fitted variogram model and the sums of squares (sserr) between the sample variogram and thefitted variogram model",,,,,,,,
